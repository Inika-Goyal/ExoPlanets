          Over 5,000 exoplanets have been confirmed to date across a wide range of sizes, compositions, and orbital configurations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some planets orbit two stars at once, much like the Tatooine system in Star Wars!
        </li>
        <li>
          Certain rocky worlds, such as 55 Cancri e, may experience diamond rain due to their carbon-rich atmospheres.
        </li>
        <li>
          One remarkable discovery, <em>WD 1856+534 b</em>, is a Jupiter-sized planet orbiting a white dwarf. It circles the dead star every 34 hours, so close that it narrowly avoids being torn apart by tidal forces and puzzles astronomers as to its origin.
